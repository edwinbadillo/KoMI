Upon clicking on this button it will bring up a crude overlay with the information. It will show you the current match and a few other matches from which you can switch to. If you don't see your match there you can also search for a new series by changing the title text field and clicking on the search icon in it. 

**Before using make sure to update the user script url which will get matched at look at the configurable flags in there as welll.**

_Disclaimer: This is a really rushed and poorly planed implementation so it is not well written code as it was meant for short term personal use. I am only sharing this because it might help one or two additional folks. You are welcome to point out issues and I'll look into fixing them at some point in time but this really needs an entire rewrite to cleanup. Whenever Gotson's Anansi Project takes off and the implementation of metadata scrappers takes off for Komga I will be glad to help implement Anilist and other manga scrappers._
